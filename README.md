### Course Description
Unprecedented advances in digital technology during the second half of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries is transforming science, including health and biomedical research. Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data analysis techniques of smaller datasets have been transformed by technologies that continue to expand the possibilities of observing and deciphering massive amounts of data in an unprecedented way. This course includes concepts from Statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering. We will learn the necessary skills to clean, visualize, and analyze data in a reproducible way. 

### Pre-Requisites 
Must have basic R programming knowledge. 

### Learning Objectives 
At the conclusion of this course student will be able to 

1) conduct data wrangling and cleaning in order to construct an informative, manageable data set; 
2) organize data analyses and make these analyses sharable and reproducible; 
3) perform exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data; 
4) communicate results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.
